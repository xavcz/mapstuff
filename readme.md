# MapStuff v0.1
Map awesome stuff with Meteor 1.3 and Mapbox, yeah \o/

To run the project, [you need a Mapbox token](https://www.mapbox.com/).

Once you have one, create a `settings.json` file and add the following :
```
{
  "public": {
    "accessToken": "YOUR_TOKEN",
    "style": "mapbox://styles/mapbox/basic-v8"
  }
}
```

Open issues, PR welcomed, cheers!
